## SVG Path Cheat Sheet

### 1. **Recognizing Polygons by Number of Sides**
- **Count the number of unique points (M/L commands) before the path closes.**
    - **Triangle:** 3 points, path closes (L ... L ... L ... L ... Z or L ... L ... L ... L ... to first point)
    - **Quadrilateral:** 4 points, but check for special cases (see below)
    - **Pentagon:** 5 points
    - **Hexagon:** 6 points
    - **Heptagon:** 7 points
    - **Octagon:** 8 points

#### **Special Cases:**
- **Kite:** 4 points, but two pairs of adjacent sides are equal, and diagonals are perpendicular. Often, the path "zig-zags" or has a "diamond" look.
- **Trapezoid:** 4 points, but only one pair of sides is parallel. Often, the path is not a rectangle or square.
- **Rectangle:** 4 points, all angles 90°, opposite sides equal.
- **Trapezoid vs. Rectangle:** If the path has 4 points and the sides are not all equal or angles not 90°, it's likely a trapezoid.

### 2. **Recognizing Ellipses and Circles**
- **Look for the `A` (arc) command.**
    - **Circle:** `A rx,ry ...` where `rx = ry` and the arc sweeps a full 360° (usually two arcs, each 180°).
    - **Ellipse:** `A rx,ry ...` where `rx ≠ ry` or the arc is not a full circle, but the path returns to the start.
    - **If the path uses two arcs to return to the start, and the radii are the same, it's a circle. If radii differ, it's an ellipse.**
    - **If the arc does not return to the start, see "Sector" below.**

### 3. **Recognizing Sectors**
- **Sector:** Path starts at a point, uses an `A` (arc) command, then returns to the center or another point, forming a "pie slice."
    - **Look for:** `M ... A ... L ... Z` or `M ... A ... L ...` (where the L returns to the center or start).
    - **If the arc is followed by a line back to the start or center, it's a sector.**

### 4. **Recognizing Kites**
- **Kite:** 4 points, but not a rectangle or trapezoid. Usually, two pairs of adjacent sides are equal, and the shape is "diamond-like."
    - **Look for:** Path that "zig-zags" or has a "pinched" look, not parallel sides.
    - **If the path is: L ... L ... L ... L ... Z, and the shape is not a rectangle or trapezoid, consider kite.**

### 5. **Recognizing Trapezoids**
- **Trapezoid:** 4 points, only one pair of sides is parallel.
    - **Look for:** L ... L ... L ... L ... Z, but the sides are not all equal, and not all angles are 90°.
    - **If the path is a closed quadrilateral but not a rectangle, square, or kite, it's likely a trapezoid.**

### 6. **Recognizing Octagons, Heptagons, etc.**
- **Count the number of unique points.**
    - **Octagon:** 8 points
    - **Heptagon:** 7 points
    - **Hexagon:** 6 points

### 7. **Recognizing Pentagons**
- **Pentagon:** 5 points, closed path.

### 8. **Recognizing Lines**
- **Line:** Only two points, no closure.

| Arc + return | Ellipse      | Two arcs, radii differ, path returns to start                         |
| Arc + return | Circle       | Two arcs, radii equal, path returns to start                          |
| Arc + line   | Sector       | Arc, then line to center or start, forming a "pie slice"              |

## **SVG Path Command Reminders**
- **M** = Move to (start point)
- **L** = Line to (draw straight line)
- **A** = Arc to (draws an arc/ellipse/circle)
- **Z** = Close path (returns to start)

---

## **Tips for the Test**
- **Count the number of unique points (M/L) before the path closes.**
- **Look for the presence of the `A` command for arcs/ellipses/sectors.**
- **If the path is a closed quadrilateral, check if it's a rectangle, kite, or trapezoid.**
- **If the path has more than 4 points, count to determine the polygon type.**
- **If the path uses arcs and returns to the start, it's likely an ellipse or circle.**
- **If the path uses arcs and then a line to the center, it's a sector.**

---

**Practice:**
- For any path, sketch the points and connect them in order to visualize the shape.
- If stuck between kite/trapezoid/rectangle, check for equal sides and right angles.
