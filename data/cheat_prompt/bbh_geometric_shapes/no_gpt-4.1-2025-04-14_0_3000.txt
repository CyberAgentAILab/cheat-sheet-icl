## SVG Path to Shape Cheat Sheet

### 1. **Recognizing Polygons by Path Structure**

#### **General Tips**
- **Count the number of unique points** (excluding repeated start/end points).
- **Look for repeated "L" (lineto) commands**: Each "L" usually means a new vertex.
- **"M" (moveto) starts a new subpath**; sometimes used for complex polygons.

#### **Polygon Sides**
- **Triangle**: 3 points, path closes after 3 lines.
- **Quadrilateral (Kite, Trapezoid, Rectangle)**: 4 points, but see below for distinctions.
- **Pentagon**: 5 points.
- **Hexagon**: 6 points.
- **Heptagon**: 7 points.
- **Octagon**: 8 points.

#### **Polygon Clues**
- **If the path has more than one "M" and several "L" commands, count all unique points.**
- **If the path returns to the starting point, it's a closed shape.**
- **If the path has a mix of "L" and "M" and the number of unique points matches a polygon, that's your answer.**

### 2. **Distinguishing Similar Quadrilaterals**

#### **Kite**
- 4 points, but two pairs of adjacent sides are equal.
- Often, the path "zig-zags" (e.g., L A B L C D L A).
- The shape looks like a diamond or arrowhead.

#### **Trapezoid**
- 4 points, but only one pair of sides is parallel.
- Often, the path is a simple 4-point closed shape, but not a rectangle or kite.
- If the points are not at right angles and not symmetric, suspect a trapezoid.

#### **Rectangle**
- 4 points, all angles 90°, sides parallel.
- Path will have four "L" commands, and the coordinates will show two x-values and two y-values.

### 3. **Recognizing Ellipses and Circles**

#### **Arc Command ("A")**
- **A rx,ry ...**: This is an elliptical arc.
- If **rx = ry** and the arc sweeps a full circle, it's a **circle**.
- If **rx ≠ ry** or the arc doesn't close a full circle, it's an **ellipse**.

#### **Full Ellipse/Circle**
- If the path is:  
  `M x1,y1 A rx,ry ... x2,y2 A rx,ry ... x1,y1`  
  and the arc flags are such that the path closes the shape, it's an ellipse or circle.

#### **Sector**
- If the path is:  
  `M x1,y1 L x2,y2 A ... L x1,y1`  
  (i.e., line to arc to line back), it's a **sector** (pie slice).

---

### 4. **Other Tricky Cases**

#### **Pentagon, Hexagon, Heptagon, Octagon**
- **Count the points**: 5, 6, 7, 8 respectively.
- **If the path is complex, count all unique "L" destinations.**
- **If the path has multiple "M" commands, include all subpaths in the count.**

#### **Multiple Subpaths**
- If the path has several "M" commands, treat each as a new segment, but count all unique points for the total.

### 5. **Quick Reference Table**

| Sides/Points | Shape      | Notes                                                      |
|--------------|------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| 3            | Triangle   | 3 unique points, closed path                              |
| 4            | Kite       | 4 points, zig-zag, not parallel sides                     |
| 4            | Trapezoid  | 4 points, only one pair of parallel sides                 |
| 4            | Rectangle  | 4 points, right angles, parallel sides                    |
| 5            | Pentagon   | 5 points, closed path                                     |
| 6            | Hexagon    | 6 points, closed path                                     |
| 7            | Heptagon   | 7 points, closed path                                     |
| 8            | Octagon    | 8 points, closed path                                     |
| Arc + Line   | Sector     | "A" command + lines, not a full ellipse/circle            |
| Arc (rx=ry)  | Circle     | "A" command, rx=ry, full circle                           |
| Arc (rx≠ry)  | Ellipse    | "A" command, rx≠ry, full ellipse                          |

### 6. **Sample Path Patterns**

- **Polygon**:  
  `M x1,y1 L x2,y2 L x3,y3 ... L xN,yN L x1,y1`  
  (N = number of sides)

- **Ellipse/Circle**:  
  `M x1,y1 A rx,ry ... x2,y2 A rx,ry ... x1,y1`  
  (rx=ry for circle, rx≠ry for ellipse)

- **Sector**:  
  `M x1,y1 L x2,y2 A ... L x1,y1`

---

### 7. **Special Notes**

- **If the path is just two points with one "L", it's a line.**
- **If the path is a single "A" command with no lines, it's an arc (part of an ellipse or circle).**
- **If the path is a mix of "L" and "A" and closes, check for sector or ellipse.**

**Use this cheat sheet to:**
- Count unique points for polygons.
- Identify arc commands for ellipses/circles/sectors.
- Distinguish between kites, trapezoids, rectangles by side/angle clues.
- Use the quick reference table for fast lookup.

**Tip:**  
When in doubt, sketch the points on scratch paper to visualize the shape!
