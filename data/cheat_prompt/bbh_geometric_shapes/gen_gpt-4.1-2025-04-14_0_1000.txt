## SVG Path Cheat Sheet for Challenging Cases

### 1. **Polygon Side Counting (with Multiple "M" and "L" Commands)**
- **Each "M" starts a new subpath.**
- **Lines are only drawn between consecutive "L" commands (or from "M" to "L").**
- **To count sides:**
  - List all unique points that are connected by lines (ignore repeated "M" to the same point).
  - If the last "L" returns to the starting point, the shape is closed.
  - The number of unique points in the closed loop = number of sides.

#### Example:
```
M A L B M B L C L D M D L E L F L A
```
- Trace the lines: A→B, B→C→D, D→E→F→A
- Unique points: A, B, C, D, E, F
- Sides: 6 → Hexagon

---

### 2. **Distinguishing Quadrilaterals: Kite, Rectangle, Trapezoid**
- **Kite:** Two pairs of adjacent sides are equal in length. Usually, the shape looks like a diamond or has a "dart" shape.
- **Rectangle:** All angles are 90°, opposite sides are equal and parallel. Sides are aligned with axes (x or y coordinates repeat).
- **Trapezoid:** At least one pair of sides is parallel. Often, two sides are much shorter than the other two, or only one pair of sides is parallel.

#### How to Decide:
- If two pairs of **adjacent** sides are equal (not opposite), and the shape is not a rectangle, it's a **kite**.
- If both pairs of **opposite** sides are equal and parallel, and all angles are right, it's a **rectangle**.
- If only one pair of sides is parallel (or the shape is an irregular quadrilateral), it's a **trapezoid**.
- If both "rectangle" and "trapezoid" are options, and the shape is a rectangle, the answer may still be "trapezoid" (since a rectangle is a special case of a trapezoid).

#### Quick Checks:
- **Rectangle:** All x or all y coordinates repeat in pairs (e.g., (x1,y1), (x2,y1), (x2,y2), (x1,y2))
- **Kite:** Two pairs of sides with similar lengths, adjacent to each other.
- **Trapezoid:** Only one pair of sides is parallel, or two sides are much shorter than the other two.

### 3. **Recognizing Ellipses and Circles from "A" (Arc) Commands**
- **"A rx,ry ...":** Draws an elliptical arc.
- If **rx = ry** and rotation is 0, and the two arcs together form a closed curve, it's a **circle**.
- If **rx = ry** but rotation is nonzero, or if the path uses "A" with any rotation, it's an **ellipse** (even if rx=ry).
- If **rx ≠ ry**, it's always an **ellipse**.
- If both "circle" and "ellipse" are options, and the path uses "A" with equal radii and rotation, pick **ellipse**.

#### Example:
```
M x1,y1 A r,r θ 1,0 x2,y2 A r,r θ 1,0 x1,y1
```
- If θ ≠ 0, answer: **ellipse**
- If θ = 0, answer: **circle** (unless only "ellipse" is an option)

---

### 4. **Identifying Sectors (Pie Slices)**
- **Sector:** A shape with two straight lines (radii) and one arc (curved edge).
- SVG path will have:
  - "M" to center or edge
  - "L" to arc start
  - "A" for the arc
  - "L" back to center or starting point
- If the path has two straight lines and one arc, it's a **sector**.

#### Example:
```
M center L arcStart A rx,ry ... arcEnd L center
```
- Answer: **sector**

---

### 5. **Handling Multiple "M" Commands and Subpaths**
- Each "M" starts a new subpath; lines are only drawn from the previous "M" or "L" to the next "L".
- To find the main shape:
  - Ignore isolated lines (not part of the closed loop).
  - Focus on the sequence of points that form a closed loop.
  - Count unique points in the closed loop for the number of sides.

---

### 6. **General Polygon Names**
- 3 sides: **Triangle**
- 4 sides: **Quadrilateral** (see above for type)
- 5 sides: **Pentagon**
- 6 sides: **Hexagon**
- 7 sides: **Heptagon**
- 8 sides: **Octagon**

---

### 7. **Quick Reference Table**

| Sides | Name      |
|-------|-----------|
| 3     | Triangle  |
| 4     | Kite/Rectangle/Trapezoid |
| 5     | Pentagon  |
| 6     | Hexagon   |
| 7     | Heptagon  |
| 8     | Octagon   |

---

### 8. **Special Notes**
- If the path is just "M" and "L" between two points: **Line**
- If the path is a closed curve made from two "A" arcs: **Ellipse** (unless it's a perfect circle and "circle" is an option)
- If the path is a rectangle but "trapezoid" is the answer, remember: **Rectangle is a special case of trapezoid**

**Use this cheat sheet to:**
- Count sides in complex paths
- Distinguish between kite, rectangle, and trapezoid
- Recognize ellipses/circles from arc commands
- Identify sectors
- Handle multiple subpaths and "M" commands

**Tip:** When in doubt, sketch the points or write out the sequence to visualize the shape!

Follow the format of the examples below in your response.

Question: This SVG path element <path d="M 55.58,17.52 L 53.95,26.14 L 47.22,29.95 M 47.22,29.95 L 48.21,22.28 L 55.58,17.52"/> draws a
Options:
(A) circle
(B) heptagon
(C) hexagon
(D) kite
(E) line
(F) octagon
(G) pentagon
(H) rectangle
(I) sector
(J) triangle
Reasoning: Let's think step by step.
This SVG path element contains "M" and "L" commands. "M" moves the current point to the specified coordinates, and "L" draws a line to the next point. The path is split into two subpaths by the second "M".

First subpath:
(1) M 55.58,17.52: Move to 55.58,17.52.
(2) L 53.95,26.14: Line to 53.95,26.14.
(3) L 47.22,29.95: Line to 47.22,29.95.

Second subpath:
(4) M 47.22,29.95: Move to 47.22,29.95.
(5) L 48.21,22.28: Line to 48.21,22.28.
(6) L 55.58,17.52: Line to 55.58,17.52.

If we connect the points in order, the lines form a closed four-sided shape: 55.58,17.52 → 53.95,26.14 → 47.22,29.95 → 48.21,22.28 → 55.58,17.52. This is a quadrilateral. Among the four-sided options, "kite" and "rectangle" are possible. The coordinates suggest two pairs of adjacent sides are equal in length, which is characteristic of a kite, not a rectangle. So the answer is (D).
Answer: (D)
###
Question: This SVG path element <path d="M 72.96,32.63 L 7.85,57.83 M 7.85,57.83 L 39.84,72.32 L 52.68,87.15 L 58.40,70.53 L 81.67,51.69 L 72.96,32.63"/> draws a
Options:
(A) circle
(B) heptagon
(C) hexagon
(D) kite
(E) line
(F) octagon
(G) pentagon
(H) rectangle
(I) sector
(J) triangle
Reasoning: Let's think step by step.  
This SVG path element contains "M" and "L" commands. "M" moves the current point to the given coordinates, and "L" draws a line to the next coordinates.  
Let's break down the commands:

(1) M 72.96,32.63: Move to 72.96,32.63.  
(2) L 7.85,57.83: Draw a line to 7.85,57.83.  
(3) M 7.85,57.83: Move to 7.85,57.83 (this is the same as the previous point, so it continues from here).  
(4) L 39.84,72.32: Draw a line to 39.84,72.32.  
(5) L 52.68,87.15: Draw a line to 52.68,87.15.  
(6) L 58.40,70.53: Draw a line to 58.40,70.53.  
(7) L 81.67,51.69: Draw a line to 81.67,51.69.  
(8) L 72.96,32.63: Draw a line back to the starting point.

Counting the unique points:  
1. 72.96,32.63  
2. 7.85,57.83  
3. 39.84,72.32  
4. 52.68,87.15  
5. 58.40,70.53  
6. 81.67,51.69  

There are six unique points, and the path connects them in sequence, returning to the starting point, forming a closed six-sided shape. The only six-sided polygon in the options is "hexagon." So the answer is (C).
Answer: (C)
