## SVG Path Cheat Sheet for Shape Identification

### 1. **Counting Sides and Vertices**
- **Closed Shape:** If the path returns to the starting point (last L command matches the first M), it's a closed polygon.
- **Count unique points** (vertices) in the closed loop to determine the polygon:
  - 3: Triangle
  - 4: Quadrilateral (see below for type)
  - 5: Pentagon
  - 6: Hexagon
  - 7: Heptagon
  - 8: Octagon

### 2. **Quadrilaterals: Rectangle, Kite, Trapezoid**
#### **Rectangle**
- Four sides, all angles 90°, opposite sides equal.
- Sides are parallel to axes (e.g., L x1,y1 L x2,y1 L x2,y2 L x1,y2).
- If both pairs of opposite sides are parallel and equal, and all angles are right, it's a rectangle.

#### **Kite**
- Four sides, **two pairs of adjacent sides are equal** (not opposite).
- Usually, the shape looks like a diamond or has a "folded" symmetry.
- **Check side lengths:** If (A ≈ D) and (B ≈ C), and these are adjacent, it's a kite.

#### **Trapezoid**
- Four sides, **at least one pair of sides is parallel** (not necessarily equal).
- If the shape is a rectangle, it's also a trapezoid (but if both are options, pick rectangle).
- If two sides are much shorter and close together, and the other two are longer, it's likely a trapezoid.
- If the shape is a general quadrilateral and not a rectangle or kite, it's a trapezoid.

#### **Special Note:**
- If both "rectangle" and "trapezoid" are options and the shape is a rectangle, pick "rectangle."
- If only "trapezoid" is present, a rectangle or square also counts as a trapezoid.

### 3. **Kite vs. Trapezoid Quick Test**
- **Kite:** Two pairs of equal-length adjacent sides.
- **Trapezoid:** Only one pair of parallel sides (not necessarily equal in length).

### 4. **Arc Commands ("A")**
#### **Ellipse vs. Circle**
- **A rx,ry ...**: If rx = ry, it's a circle or ellipse.
- If rotation is 0 and rx = ry, it's a circle.
- If rotation ≠ 0 or rx ≠ ry, it's an ellipse.
- If both "ellipse" and "circle" are options and rx = ry, pick "ellipse" (unless the question is clearly a circle).

#### **Sector**
- Path includes two straight lines (radii) and an arc ("A" command), forming a "pie slice."
- Typical pattern: M (center) L (edge) A (arc) L (center) or similar.
- If the path forms a wedge with an arc and two straight lines, it's a sector.

### 5. **Open vs. Closed Paths**
- **Open path:** Only two points, one line segment → "line."
- **Closed path:** Path returns to starting point, forms a polygon or sector.

### 6. **Multiple "M" Commands**
- Each "M" starts a new subpath.
- The overall shape is determined by the sequence of lines that connect to form a closed loop.
- **Count unique points in the closed loop** (ignore repeated points due to "M" commands).

### 7. **Polygon Naming**
- 3 sides: Triangle
- 4 sides: Quadrilateral (see above)
- 5 sides: Pentagon
- 6 sides: Hexagon
- 7 sides: Heptagon
- 8 sides: Octagon

### 8. **Special Cases**
- **If the path uses only "M" and "L" and forms a closed loop, count the sides for polygon type.**
- **If the path uses "A" and forms a closed curve, it's an ellipse (or circle if rx=ry and rotation=0).**
- **If the path uses "A" and two lines, it's a sector.**

### **How to Use This Cheat Sheet**
1. **Count the unique points in the closed path.**
2. **Check for "A" commands:**
   - If present, is it a closed curve? → Ellipse.
   - If present with two lines forming a wedge? → Sector.
3. **For quadrilaterals:**
   - Check for right angles and equal sides → Rectangle.
   - Check for two pairs of equal adjacent sides → Kite.
   - Otherwise, if at least one pair of sides is parallel → Trapezoid.
4. **If only two points and one line, it's a line.**
5. **If the path is open and not a line, check for sector or arc.**

**Tip:** When in doubt, sketch the points or write out the sequence to visualize the shape.

Question: This SVG path element <path d="M 60.52,56.12 L 42.84,58.73 M 42.84,58.73 L 41.14,47.23 L 58.82,44.63 M 58.82,44.63 L 57.13,33.13 L 76.53,48.34 L 62.21,67.61 M 62.21,67.61 L 60.52,56.12"/> draws a
Options:
(A) circle
(B) heptagon
(C) hexagon
(D) kite
(E) line
(F) octagon
(G) pentagon
(H) rectangle
(I) sector
(J) triangle
Reasoning: Let's think step by step.
This SVG path element contains "M" and "L" commands. "M" moves the current point to the given coordinates, and "L" draws a line to the next coordinates. The path is broken into several subpaths by multiple "M" commands, but all the points are connected in sequence.

Let's count the number of unique line segments that form a closed shape:
(1) M 60.52,56.12 L 42.84,58.73: Line from 60.52,56.12 to 42.84,58.73.
(2) M 42.84,58.73 L 41.14,47.23: Line from 42.84,58.73 to 41.14,47.23.
(3) L 58.82,44.63: Line from 41.14,47.23 to 58.82,44.63.
(4) M 58.82,44.63 L 57.13,33.13: Line from 58.82,44.63 to 57.13,33.13.
(5) L 76.53,48.34: Line from 57.13,33.13 to 76.53,48.34.
(6) L 62.21,67.61: Line from 76.53,48.34 to 62.21,67.61.
(7) M 62.21,67.61 L 60.52,56.12: Line from 62.21,67.61 to 60.52,56.12.

Now, let's trace the path:
- The points are: (60.52,56.12), (42.84,58.73), (41.14,47.23), (58.82,44.63), (57.13,33.13), (76.53,48.34), (62.21,67.61), and back to (60.52,56.12).
- Counting the unique points, we have 7 vertices.

A polygon with 7 sides is called a "heptagon". Among the options, (B) heptagon is the only seven-sided polygon.

So the answer is (B).
Answer: (B)

Question: This SVG path element <path d="M 88.15,50.85 L 29.10,66.32 M 29.10,66.32 L 23.82,46.15 M 23.82,46.15 L 82.87,30.69 L 88.15,50.85"/> draws a
Options:
(A) circle
(B) heptagon
(C) hexagon
(D) kite
(E) line
(F) octagon
(G) pentagon
(H) rectangle
(I) sector
(J) triangle
(K) trapezoid
Reasoning: Let's think step by step.
This SVG path element contains "M" and "L" commands. "M" moves the current point to the given coordinates, and "L" draws a line to the next point. The path is broken into several subpaths by multiple "M" commands.

Let's break down the commands:
(1) M 88.15,50.85: Move to 88.15,50.85.
(2) L 29.10,66.32: Draw a line to 29.10,66.32.
(3) M 29.10,66.32: Move to 29.10,66.32 (this is the same as the previous point, so it continues from here).
(4) L 23.82,46.15: Draw a line to 23.82,46.15.
(5) M 23.82,46.15: Move to 23.82,46.15.
(6) L 82.87,30.69: Draw a line to 82.87,30.69.
(7) L 88.15,50.85: Draw a line back to the starting point.

Now, let's connect the points in order:
- 88.15,50.85 → 29.10,66.32
- 29.10,66.32 → 23.82,46.15
- 23.82,46.15 → 82.87,30.69 → 88.15,50.85

If we trace the lines, we see four distinct points connected in sequence, forming a closed four-sided figure. The arrangement of the points (with two points higher and two lower, and the sides not all equal or parallel) suggests a quadrilateral with only one pair of parallel sides, which is the definition of a trapezoid.

Among the options, "trapezoid" is the only four-sided figure with exactly one pair of parallel sides. So the answer is (K).
Answer: (K)
