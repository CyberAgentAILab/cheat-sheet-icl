**Alphabetical Sorting Cheat Sheet (for Difficult Cases)**

---

### 1. **General Approach**
- **Step 1:** Compare the first letter of each word.
- **Step 2:** If first letters are the same, compare the second letter, then third, etc., until a difference is found.
- **Step 3:** If one word is a prefix of another (e.g., "trail" vs "trailside"), the shorter word comes first.
- **Step 4:** For ties, continue comparing subsequent letters.

---

### 2. **Handling Groups with Same Starting Letters**
- **List all words with the same first letter together.**
- **Compare the second letter:**
  - If different, order by the second letter.
  - If the same, compare the third letter, and so on.
- **If all compared letters are the same but one word is shorter, the shorter word comes first.**

**Example:**
- ["can't", "cascade", "condiment", "consignee"]
  - 2nd letter: a, a, o, o → "can't", "cascade" before "condiment", "consignee"
  - 3rd letter: n, s, n, n → "can't" before "cascade"
  - For "condiment" vs "consignee": 4th letter d vs s → "condiment" before "consignee"

---

### 3. **Sorting Within Groups**
- **For each group with the same first letter, sort by the next letter.**
- **If multiple words have the same first and second letter, continue to the third, etc.**

**Example:**
- ["scottish", "scrumptious"]
  - 3rd letter: o vs r → "scottish" before "scrumptious"

---

### 4. **Special Cases**
- **Prefix Rule:** If one word is a prefix of another, the shorter word comes first.
  - E.g., "trail" < "trailside"
- **Apostrophes and Special Characters:** Ignore apostrophes and treat as if the letter is not there.
  - E.g., "o'connell" is treated as "oconnell"

---

### 5. **Step-by-Step Example for a Complex List**
Given: ["can't", "cascade", "condiment", "consignee"]
- 1st letter: all "c"
- 2nd letter: a, a, o, o → "can't", "cascade" before "condiment", "consignee"
- 3rd letter: n, s, n, n → "can't" before "cascade"
- For "condiment" and "consignee": 4th letter d vs s → "condiment" before "consignee"
- **Final order:** can't, cascade, condiment, consignee

---

### 6. **When in Doubt:**
- **Write out the words vertically, aligning letters, and compare each column.**
- **If stuck, write the alphabet and assign each letter a number to help compare.**

---

### 7. **Common Pitfalls**
- **Don't just look at the first letter!**
- **Don't forget to check for prefix situations.**
- **Be careful with words that have similar beginnings but diverge later.**

---

### 8. **Practice**
- **Group words by first letter.**
- **Within each group, sort by the next letter, and so on.**
- **Always check for prefix cases.**

**Summary Table for Sorting:**

| Step | What to Compare? | Action |
|------|------------------|--------|
| 1    | First letter     | Group words |
| 2    | Second letter    | Sort within group |
| 3    | Third letter     | Continue sorting |
| 4    | Prefix?          | Shorter word first |
| 5    | Special chars    | Ignore apostrophes |

**Use this process for any list, especially when words are similar or have many shared starting letters!**

Follow the format of the examples below in your response.

Question: Sort the following words alphabetically: List: oblong bucolic whoosh
Reasoning: Let's think step by step.  
The first letter: "oblong": "o" (15). "bucolic": "b" (2). "whoosh": "w" (23). We now have: (2) "bucolic" < (15) "oblong" < (23) "whoosh".  
So the answer is bucolic oblong whoosh.
Answer: bucolic oblong whoosh

Question: Sort the following words alphabetically: List: spontaneity smooth execrable epaulet bobbin calumny hun anastasia omnipotent award hostelry macedon roughshod burrow align apache putty adsorption anastomotic
Reasoning: Let's think step by step.
The first letter: "spontaneity": "s" (19). "smooth": "s" (19). "execrable": "e" (5). "epaulet": "e" (5). "bobbin": "b" (2). "calumny": "c" (3). "hun": "h" (8). "anastasia": "a" (1). "omnipotent": "o" (15). "award": "a" (1). "hostelry": "h" (8). "macedon": "m" (13). "roughshod": "r" (18). "burrow": "b" (2). "align": "a" (1). "apache": "a" (1). "putty": "p" (16). "adsorption": "a" (1). "anastomotic": "a" (1).

Now, group by first letter:
(1) ["adsorption", "align", "anastasia", "anastomotic", "apache", "award"]
(2) ["bobbin", "burrow"]
(3) "calumny"
(5) ["epaulet", "execrable"]
(8) ["hostelry", "hun"]
(13) "macedon"
(15) "omnipotent"
(16) "putty"
(18) "roughshod"
(19) ["smooth", "spontaneity"]

Now, sort each group:
- "a" group: Compare second letters:
  - "adsorption": "d"
  - "align": "l"
  - "anastasia": "n"
  - "anastomotic": "n"
  - "apache": "p"
  - "award": "w"
  So order: adsorption, align, anastasia, anastomotic, apache, award

- "b" group: "bobbin" vs "burrow"
  - Second letter: "bobbin": "o", "burrow": "u" → "bobbin" < "burrow"

- "e" group: "epaulet" vs "execrable"
  - Second letter: "p" vs "x" → "epaulet" < "execrable"

- "h" group: "hostelry" vs "hun"
  - Second letter: "o" vs "u" → "hostelry" < "hun"

- "s" group: "smooth" vs "spontaneity"
  - Second letter: "m" vs "p" → "smooth" < "spontaneity"

Now, combine all in order:
adsorption align anastasia anastomotic apache award bobbin burrow calumny epaulet execrable hostelry hun macedon omnipotent putty roughshod smooth spontaneity

So the answer is adsorption align anastasia anastomotic apache award bobbin burrow calumny epaulet execrable hostelry hun macedon omnipotent putty roughshod smooth spontaneity.
Answer: adsorption align anastasia anastomotic apache award bobbin burrow calumny epaulet execrable hostelry hun macedon omnipotent putty roughshod smooth spontaneity
