**Alphabetical Sorting Cheat Sheet**

Use this guide for sorting lists of words alphabetically, especially for long or tricky lists.

---

### 1. **General Rules**
- **Sort by the first letter** of each word.
- If the first letter is the same, **compare the second letter**, and so on.
- **Ignore case** (treat uppercase and lowercase as the same).
- **Spaces and punctuation**: Ignore spaces, apostrophes, hyphens, and other punctuation for sorting purposes.
- **Numbers**: If present, numbers come before letters.

---

### 2. **Step-by-Step Process**
1. **Write all words in a vertical list.**
2. **Compare the first letter** of each word.
3. If two or more words share the same first letter, **compare the next letter**.
4. Continue comparing subsequent letters until the order is clear.
5. If a word is a prefix of another (e.g., "bat" and "batch"), the shorter word comes first.

---

### 3. **Special Cases**
- **Identical beginnings**: If words start with the same sequence, the shorter word comes first.
  - Example: "bat", "batch" → "bat" before "batch"
- **Hyphenated/compound words**: Treat as if the hyphen is not there.
  - Example: "co-op", "coop" → "co-op" before "coop" (since "-" is ignored, "co-op" is treated as "coop")
- **Apostrophes and other punctuation**: Ignore for sorting.
  - Example: "can't", "cant" → "cant" before "can't"
- **Spaces**: Ignore spaces.
  - Example: "new york", "newark" → "new york" before "newark"
- **Numbers**: If a word starts with a number, it comes before words starting with letters.

---

### 4. **Tricky Letter Pairs**
- **'ch' vs 'ci'**: "ch" comes before "ci" (e.g., "char", "ciao")
- **'ph' vs 'pi'**: "ph" comes before "pi" (e.g., "phase", "piano")
- **'qu' vs 'ra'**: "qu" comes before "ra" (e.g., "quack", "rabbit")
- **'s' vs 'sh'**: "s" comes before "sh" (e.g., "sap", "sham")
- **'st' vs 'su'**: "st" comes before "su" (e.g., "star", "sun")
- **'th' vs 'ti'**: "th" comes before "ti" (e.g., "than", "tide")
- **'w' vs 'wh'**: "w" comes before "wh" (e.g., "war", "what")

---

### 5. **Handling Long Lists**
- **Write the words in a column.**
- **Sort in stages**: First by first letter, then by second, etc.
- **Group words with the same starting letters together** and sort those subgroups.

---

### 6. **Practice with Examples**
- **Example 1**: "align", "allot", "alot"
  - "align" (a-l-i), "allot" (a-l-l), "alot" (a-l-o)
  - Order: "align", "allot", "alot"
- **Example 2**: "bat", "batch", "bath"
  - "bat" (b-a-t), "batch" (b-a-t-c), "bath" (b-a-t-h)
  - Order: "bat", "batch", "bath"
- **Example 3**: "ape", "apex", "apiece"
  - "ape" (a-p-e), "apex" (a-p-e-x), "apiece" (a-p-i)
  - Order: "ape", "apex", "apiece"

---

### 7. **Common Mistakes to Avoid**
- **Don’t sort by word length** unless all letters are identical up to the length of the shorter word.
- **Don’t skip letters**: Always compare each letter in order.
- **Don’t be distracted by capitalization or punctuation**.

### 8. **Quick Reference Table**

| Letter Order | Example |
|--------------|---------|
| a before b   | apple, banana |
| ab before ac | abbot, ace |
| bat before batch | bat, batch |
| can before can't | can, can't |
| co before con | coat, cone |
| s before sh  | sap, sham |
| st before su | star, sun |
| t before th  | tab, than |
| w before wh  | war, what |

---

### 9. **If Stuck**
- Write the words out, one per line.
- Compare letter by letter.
- If two words are identical up to a point, the shorter word comes first.

---

**Tip:** For very long lists, consider breaking them into smaller groups, sorting each, then merging.

---

**Remember:** Alphabetical order is determined by comparing each letter in sequence, ignoring case and punctuation, and shorter words come first if all compared letters are the same.
