**Alphabetical Sorting Cheat Sheet (for Difficult Cases)**

---

### 1. **General Approach**
- **Step 1:** Compare the first letter of each word.
- **Step 2:** If first letters are the same, compare the second letter, then third, etc.
- **Step 3:** If one word is a prefix of another (e.g., "cat" vs "cater"), the shorter word comes first.
- **Step 4:** For ties, continue comparing subsequent letters until a difference is found.

---

### 2. **Handling Groups with Same Starting Letters**
- **List all words with the same first letter together.**
- **Compare the second letter:**
  - If different, order by the second letter.
  - If the same, compare the third letter, and so on.
- **If all compared letters are the same but one word is shorter, the shorter word comes first.**

**Example:**
- ["cat", "cater", "catfish"]
  - "cat" < "cater" < "catfish"

---

### 3. **Sorting Multiple Words with Shared Prefixes**
- **Write out the words vertically, aligning letters:**
  ```
  c a t
  c a t e r
  c a t f i s h
  ```
- **Compare each column until a difference is found.**

---

### 4. **Special Cases**
- **Apostrophes and spaces:** Ignore them for sorting (e.g., "o'connell" is sorted as if it were "oconnell").
- **Case sensitivity:** Ignore case; treat all letters as lowercase.

---

### 5. **Step-by-Step Example for Complex Groups**

#### Example: ["contemporaneous", "contravariant", "cordial", "collet"]
- All start with "co".
- Third letter: "n" (contemporaneous, contravariant), "r" (cordial), "l" (collet)
- So, "collet" < "contemporaneous"/"contravariant" < "cordial"
- For "contemporaneous" vs "contravariant":
  - Fourth letter: "t" (both)
  - Fifth letter: "e" (contemporaneous), "r" (contravariant)
  - So, "contemporaneous" < "contravariant"

**Final order:** collet < contemporaneous < contravariant < cordial

---

### 6. **Sorting Within Groups**
- **If you have a group like ["beefsteak", "beware"],**
  - Compare third letter: "e" (beefsteak), "w" (beware)
  - So, "beefsteak" < "beware"

---

### 7. **Sorting Words with Identical Letters Up to a Point**
- **If two words are identical up to a certain letter, the word that ends first comes first.**
  - "cat" < "cater" < "caterpillar"

---

### 8. **Quick Reference Table for Letter Order**
| Letter | Position |
|--------|----------|
| a      | 1        |
| b      | 2        |
| c      | 3        |
| ...    | ...      |
| z      | 26       |

---

### 9. **Practice:**
- **Write out the words in columns to compare letters.**
- **Group by first letter, then sort within each group.**
- **Always check for shorter word if all compared letters are the same.**

---

### 10. **Common Pitfalls**
- **Don't forget to check the next letter if the first is the same.**
- **Don't overlook shorter words coming before longer words with the same prefix.**
- **Be careful with words that have similar beginnings but diverge later.**

Question: Sort the following words alphabetically: List: burley bela arapaho bacteria bock
Reasoning: Let's think step by step.
The first letter: "burley": "b" (2). "bela": "b" (2). "arapaho": "a" (1). "bacteria": "b" (2). "bock": "b" (2). We now have: (1) "arapaho" < (2) ["bacteria", "bela", "bock", "burley"]. Now let's sort this subpart ["bacteria", "bela", "bock", "burley"] by looking at their second letters.
The second letter: "bacteria": "a" (1). "bela": "e" (5). "bock": "o" (15). "burley": "u" (21). We now have: (1) "bacteria" < (5) "bela" < (15) "bock" < (21) "burley".
So the answer is arapaho bacteria bela bock burley.
Answer: arapaho bacteria bela bock burley

Question: Sort the following words alphabetically: List: daffy hypothesis croupier dockyard household peccary triode minstrelsy nepotism sawtimber mantic info confess serenade summate silver duty loam mandate
Reasoning: Let's think step by step.  
The first letter:  
"daffy": "d" (4)  
"hypothesis": "h" (8)  
"croupier": "c" (3)  
"dockyard": "d" (4)  
"household": "h" (8)  
"peccary": "p" (16)  
"triode": "t" (20)  
"minstrelsy": "m" (13)  
"nepotism": "n" (14)  
"sawtimber": "s" (19)  
"mantic": "m" (13)  
"info": "i" (9)  
"confess": "c" (3)  
"serenade": "s" (19)  
"summate": "s" (19)  
"silver": "s" (19)  
"duty": "d" (4)  
"loam": "l" (12)  
"mandate": "m" (13)  

Now, group by first letter:  
(3) ["croupier", "confess"]  
(4) ["daffy", "dockyard", "duty"]  
(8) ["hypothesis", "household"]  
(9) "info"  
(12) "loam"  
(13) ["mandate", "mantic", "minstrelsy"]  
(14) "nepotism"  
(16) "peccary"  
(19) ["sawtimber", "serenade", "summate", "silver"]  
(20) "triode"  

Now, sort within each group:  
["croupier", "confess"]:  
Compare second letter: "croupier" ("r"), "confess" ("o"). "confess" < "croupier".  
So: "confess" < "croupier"  

["daffy", "dockyard", "duty"]:  
Second letter: "daffy" ("a"), "dockyard" ("o"), "duty" ("u").  
So: "daffy" < "dockyard" < "duty"  

["hypothesis", "household"]:  
Second letter: "hypothesis" ("y"), "household" ("o").  
"household" < "hypothesis"  

["mandate", "mantic", "minstrelsy"]:  
Second letter: "mandate" ("a"), "mantic" ("a"), "minstrelsy" ("i").  
So "mandate" < "mantic" < "minstrelsy"  

["sawtimber", "serenade", "summate", "silver"]:  
Second letter: "a" ("sawtimber"), "e" ("serenade"), "u" ("summate"), "i" ("silver").  
Order: "sawtimber" < "serenade" < "silver" < "summate"  

Now, combine all:  
confess < croupier < daffy < dockyard < duty < household < hypothesis < info < loam < mandate < mantic < minstrelsy < nepotism < peccary < sawtimber < serenade < silver < summate < triode  

So the answer is confess croupier daffy dockyard duty household hypothesis info loam mandate mantic minstrelsy nepotism peccary sawtimber serenade silver summate triode.
Answer: confess croupier daffy dockyard duty household hypothesis info loam mandate mantic minstrelsy nepotism peccary sawtimber serenade silver summate triode
