**ALPHABETICAL SORTING CHEAT SHEET**

Use this guide to help you alphabetize word lists, especially for tricky or confusing cases.

---

### 1. **General Steps**
- Compare words letter by letter, left to right.
- If the first letters are the same, move to the next letter, and so on.
- If one word is a prefix of another (e.g., "bat" and "batch"), the shorter word comes first.

---

### 2. **Special Cases & Tips**

#### **A. Handling Capitalization**
- Ignore capitalization; treat all words as lowercase.

#### **B. Handling Apostrophes, Hyphens, and Special Characters**
- Apostrophes and hyphens are ignored for sorting purposes.
  - Example: "can't" is sorted as "cant".
- Words with apostrophes come after otherwise identical words without them.
  - Example: "cant" before "can't".

#### **C. Handling Spaces**
- Spaces are ignored; treat as if the word is continuous.

#### **D. Handling Accents and Diacritics**
- Treat accented letters as their unaccented equivalents (e.g., é = e).

#### **E. Handling Numbers**
- If a word starts with a number, it comes before all words starting with letters.

#### **F. Handling Identical Beginnings**
- If two words share the same beginning, the shorter word comes first.
  - Example: "bat" before "batch".

#### **G. Handling "O'" and "Mc"/"Mac"**
- "O'" is treated as "O" (ignore the apostrophe).
- "Mc" and "Mac" are sorted as written, not as the same.

#### **H. Handling "St." and "Saint"**
- Sort as written; "St" comes before "Saint".

### 3. **Step-by-Step Example**

**List:**  
"bunny", "bun", "bunsen", "bunco"

**Process:**
1. Compare "bun" vs "bunny": "bun" is shorter, so it comes first.
2. "bun" vs "bunco": "bun" is shorter, so it comes first.
3. "bunco" vs "bunny": Compare letter by letter: "bunco" (c) vs "bunny" (n), c comes before n.
4. "bunsen" vs "bunco": Compare letter by letter: "bunco" (c) vs "bunsen" (s), c comes before s.

**Order:**  
bun, bunco, bunny, bunsen

### 4. **Common Pitfalls**

- **Don't sort by word length unless all letters up to that point are identical.**
- **Don't group by word type (noun, verb, etc.)—just by spelling.**
- **Don't skip over the second or third letter if the first is the same.**
- **Don't let similar-sounding words confuse you—sort by spelling, not pronunciation.**

### 5. **Practice with Tricky Letters**

- **"ae" vs "aen"**: "ae" comes before "aen"
- **"mac" vs "mace"**: "mac" comes before "mace"
- **"o'connor" vs "olsen"**: "o'connor" comes before "olsen"

### 7. **If Stuck:**

- Write the words vertically, one letter per line, and compare each column.
- For long lists, sort pairs, then merge.

---

**Remember:**  
- Go letter by letter.
- Ignore case, spaces, and punctuation.
- Shorter word comes first if all compared letters are the same.
