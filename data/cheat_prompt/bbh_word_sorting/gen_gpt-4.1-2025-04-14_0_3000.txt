**Alphabetical Sorting Cheat Sheet (for Difficult Cases)**

---

### 1. **General Approach**
- **Step 1:** List all words.
- **Step 2:** Group by first letter (a, b, c, ... z).
- **Step 3:** Within each group, compare the second letter, then third, etc., until order is determined.
- **Step 4:** If two words are identical up to the length of the shorter word, the shorter word comes first (e.g., "cat" < "cater").
- **Step 5:** Combine all groups in order.

---

### 2. **Tiebreakers: How to Compare Letters**
- Compare the first letter. If tied, compare the second letter, and so on.
- If one word runs out of letters (is shorter), it comes first.
  - Example: "cat" < "cater" (since "cat" ends before "cater" does).

---

### 3. **Handling Multiple Words with Same Starting Letters**
- **Example:** ["beefsteak", "beware"]
  - 1st: b, 2nd: e, 3rd: e (tied)
  - 4th: f ("beefsteak") vs. w ("beware") → f < w, so "beefsteak" < "beware"
- **Example:** ["birthplace", "bicycle"]
  - 1st: b, 2nd: i, 3rd: r ("birthplace") vs. c ("bicycle") → c < r, so "bicycle" < "birthplace"

---

### 4. **Sorting Steps for Groups**
- **Step 1:** For each group with the same first letter, list all words.
- **Step 2:** Compare the second letter for each.
- **Step 3:** If tied, compare the third letter, and so on.
- **Step 4:** If all compared letters are the same and one word is shorter, the shorter word comes first.

---

### 5. **Special Cases**
- **Apostrophes and Non-letters:** Ignore apostrophes and treat as if not present (e.g., "won't" is sorted as "wont").
- **Case Sensitivity:** Ignore case; treat all letters as lowercase.

---

### 6. **Sample Walkthrough**
#### Example: ["beefsteak", "beware", "bicycle", "birthplace"]
- All start with "b"
- 2nd letter: e, e, i, i → "beefsteak", "beware" < "bicycle", "birthplace"
- "beefsteak" vs "beware": 3rd letter e vs w → e < w, so "beefsteak" < "beware"
- "bicycle" vs "birthplace": 3rd letter c vs r → c < r, so "bicycle" < "birthplace"
- Final order: beefsteak, beware, bicycle, birthplace

### 7. **Quick Reference Table**
| Step | What to Compare? | Example |
|------|------------------|---------|
| 1    | First letter     | "cat" vs "dog" → c < d |
| 2    | Second letter    | "cat" vs "car" → t > r, so "car" < "cat" |
| 3    | Third letter     | "cart" vs "carp" → t > p, so "carp" < "cart" |
| 4    | Word length      | "cat" vs "cater" → "cat" < "cater" |

---

### 8. **Practice:**
- Write out the words in columns, compare each letter in order.
- For large lists, group by first letter, then sort each group.

---

**Remember:**  
- Always compare letter by letter.
- If you get stuck, write the words vertically and compare each column.
- Shorter word comes first if all compared letters are the same.

---

**Use this process for any list, especially when words share several starting letters!**

Follow the format of the examples below in your response.

Question: Sort the following words alphabetically: List: postcondition protoplasmic musicology helical uptrend vasoconstriction diacritic beefsteak beware birthplace bicycle junctor state obstinate banshee sap
Reasoning: Let's think step by step.  
The first letter:  
"postcondition": "p" (16)  
"protoplasmic": "p" (16)  
"musicology": "m" (13)  
"helical": "h" (8)  
"uptrend": "u" (21)  
"vasoconstriction": "v" (22)  
"diacritic": "d" (4)  
"beefsteak": "b" (2)  
"beware": "b" (2)  
"birthplace": "b" (2)  
"bicycle": "b" (2)  
"junctor": "j" (10)  
"state": "s" (19)  
"obstinate": "o" (15)  
"banshee": "b" (2)  
"sap": "s" (19)  

Now, group all the "b" words: ["banshee", "beefsteak", "beware", "birthplace", "bicycle"].  
Sort these by the second letter:  
"banshee": "a" (1)  
"beefsteak": "e" (5)  
"beware": "e" (5)  
"birthplace": "i" (9)  
"bicycle": "i" (9)  
So, "banshee" < ["beefsteak" ? "beware"] < ["birthplace" ? "bicycle"].  
Sort "beefsteak" vs "beware" by third letter:  
"beefsteak": "e" (5)  
"beware": "w" (23)  
So, "beefsteak" < "beware".  
Sort "birthplace" vs "bicycle" by third letter:  
"birthplace": "r" (18)  
"bicycle": "c" (3)  
So, "bicycle" < "birthplace".  
So, the "b" words in order: banshee beefsteak beware bicycle birthplace.  

Now, continue with the rest:  
"diacritic" (d), "helical" (h), "junctor" (j), "musicology" (m), "obstinate" (o), "postcondition" (p), "protoplasmic" (p), "sap" (s), "state" (s), "uptrend" (u), "vasoconstriction" (v).  
Order by first letter:  
d < h < j < m < o < [p, p] < [s, s] < u < v  
So: diacritic helical junctor musicology obstinate postcondition protoplasmic sap state uptrend vasoconstriction.  

Combine with the "b" words at the start:  
banshee beefsteak beware bicycle birthplace diacritic helical junctor musicology obstinate postcondition protoplasmic sap state uptrend vasoconstriction.  

So the answer is banshee beefsteak beware bicycle birthplace diacritic helical junctor musicology obstinate postcondition protoplasmic sap state uptrend vasoconstriction.
Answer: banshee beefsteak beware bicycle birthplace diacritic helical junctor musicology obstinate postcondition protoplasmic sap state uptrend vasoconstriction

Question: Sort the following words alphabetically: List: pea yonkers darkle quadrant moldboard instant olsen hookup erudite lip
Reasoning: Let's think step by step.
The first letter: "pea": "p" (16). "yonkers": "y" (25). "darkle": "d" (4). "quadrant": "q" (17). "moldboard": "m" (13). "instant": "i" (9). "olsen": "o" (15). "hookup": "h" (8). "erudite": "e" (5). "lip": "l" (12). We now have: (4) "darkle" < (5) "erudite" < (8) "hookup" < (9) "instant" < (12) "lip" < (13) "moldboard" < (15) "olsen" < (16) "pea" < (17) "quadrant" < (25) "yonkers". No ties, so the order is: darkle erudite hookup instant lip moldboard olsen pea quadrant yonkers.
Answer: darkle erudite hookup instant lip moldboard olsen pea quadrant yonkers
