**Alphabetical Sorting Cheat Sheet**

Use this guide for sorting lists of words alphabetically, especially for tricky or confusing cases.

---

### 1. **General Rules**
- **Sort by the first letter** of each word.
- If the first letter is the same, **compare the second letter**, and so on.
- **Ignore case**: Treat uppercase and lowercase letters as equal.
- **Do not ignore spaces or punctuation**: If present, sort by ASCII order (space comes before letters).
- **Do not ignore accents or diacritics**: Treat them as part of the letter (e.g., é after e).

### 2. **Step-by-Step Process**
1. **Write all words in a vertical list.**
2. **Compare the first letter** of each word.
3. If two or more words share the same first letter, **compare the next letter**.
4. **Continue comparing letters** until a difference is found.
5. **Shorter words come first** if one word is a prefix of another (e.g., "bat" before "batch").
6. **If all letters are the same**, the words are identical.

### 3. **Special Cases & Tips**

#### a. **Words with Same Prefix**
- Example: "bat", "batch", "baton"
  - Order: bat, batch, baton

#### b. **Words with Spaces or Hyphens**
- Spaces come before letters.
- Example: "black bird", "blackbird"
  - Order: black bird, blackbird

#### c. **Words with Apostrophes or Punctuation**
- Apostrophes come before letters.
- Example: "can't", "cant"
  - Order: can't, cant

#### d. **Words with Numbers**
- Numbers come before letters.
- Example: "2fast", "fast"
  - Order: 2fast, fast

#### e. **Words with Accents**
- Treat accented letters as their base letter, but after the unaccented version.
- Example: "resume", "résumé"
  - Order: resume, résumé

#### f. **Words with Uppercase and Lowercase**
- Ignore case: "Apple" and "apple" are treated the same.

#### g. **Words with 'Mc', 'Mac', etc.**
- Sort as written, do not treat "Mc" as "Mac".

### 4. **Tricky Letter Comparisons**
- **Order of letters**: a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z
- **Compare each letter in order**.
- If one word runs out of letters, it comes first.
  - Example: "cat", "cater"
    - Order: cat, cater
