**Cheat Sheet for Plausibility Questions (Difficult Cases Only)**

---

### 1. **Identifying the Athlete’s Sport**
- **If you don’t know the athlete’s sport, look for clues in the name or context.**
- If the athlete is not from the sport mentioned in the action/event, the answer is almost always **no**.

---

### 2. **Trick Plays & Rare Events**
- **Football (NFL):**  
  - *Quarterbacks* usually throw passes, but can catch passes on trick plays (e.g., "caught the screen pass" is plausible for a QB).
  - *Wide receivers* usually catch passes, but can throw passes on trick plays (e.g., "threw a touchdown" is plausible for a WR).
- **Hockey:**  
  - *Goalies* rarely score, but it is possible (e.g., "scored in the third period" for a goalie is rare but plausible).
- **Soccer:**  
  - Scoring directly from a corner kick is rare but possible (called an "Olympic goal").
- **Baseball:**  
  - Pitchers can bat and walk to first base, especially in the National League.

- **"Give and go":**  
  - Used in both soccer and basketball, but not in hockey or baseball.

### 5. **Common Actions by Position**
- **Football:**
  - *Quarterbacks* throw/catch passes, can fumble, can be flagged.
  - *Wide receivers* catch passes, can throw on trick plays.
- **Baseball:**
  - *Any player* can be out/safe at a base, walk, strike out, hit, etc.
- **Hockey:**
  - *Any player* can pass/shoot the puck, skate backwards, enter attacking zone, be in penalty box.
- **Soccer:**
  - *Any player* can score, take a throw-in, get a red card, perform a give and go, maradona, nutmeg, etc.

---

### 6. **Unlikely but Possible**
- If the action is rare but possible (e.g., a goalie scoring in hockey, a WR throwing a touchdown in football), **answer yes** if the sport and event match.

---

### 7. **Name Ambiguity**
- If the name is common and not specific to a known player in the sport of the action, **answer no** (e.g., "Pedro struck out the side"—Pedro is a soccer player, not a known baseball pitcher).
