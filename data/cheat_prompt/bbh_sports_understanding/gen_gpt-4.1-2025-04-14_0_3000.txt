**Cheat Sheet for Plausibility Questions (Sports & Athlete Contexts)**

---

### 1. **Identifying Athlete’s Sport**
- **If you don’t know the athlete,** look for context clues in the sentence (e.g., “Stanley Cup” = hockey, “Superbowl” = football, “Champions League” = soccer, “NBA” = basketball, “National League Championship Series” = baseball).
- **If the athlete’s name is ambiguous or common (e.g., “Pedro”),** and the context doesn’t match a known player in that sport, the answer is likely **no**.

**Use this sheet to quickly check:**
- Athlete’s sport
- Action/term’s sport
- Event/competition’s sport
- If all three match, answer is YES. If not, answer is NO. If unsure about the athlete, use context clues or default to NO if the context is implausible.
