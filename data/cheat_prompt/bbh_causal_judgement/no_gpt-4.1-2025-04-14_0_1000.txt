# Causation & Intentionality Cheat Sheet

## 1. **Overdetermination & Multiple Sufficient Causes**
- **Definition:** When multiple independent actions are each sufficient to bring about an effect, but only one is needed.
- **Rule:** If *either* of two (or more) actions is sufficient for the outcome, and both occur, **the less expected or less typical cause is usually NOT considered the cause** by ordinary people.
- **Cues:**
  - "Either A or B is enough for X to happen."
  - Both A and B occur.
  - **Answer:** The less expected/typical one = **No**; the more expected/typical one = **Yes**.
- **Examples:**
  - Two people log in, either is enough to crash the computer, both log in: the one who is supposed to log in is NOT the cause; the one who violates policy IS the cause.
  - Two committees can approve, both do, but one almost always does: the rare approval is NOT the cause.

---

## 2. **Joint Necessity (Conjunctive Causes)**
- **Definition:** When two (or more) conditions must BOTH be met for an effect.
- **Rule:** If both A and B are required for X, and both occur, **each is considered a cause**.
- **Cues:**
  - "X happens if both A and B."
  - Both A and B occur.
  - **Answer:** For either A or B, **Yes**.
- **Examples:**
  - "Building implodes if both safety switch is off AND knob A is on." If you change knob A to on, **Yes**.
  - "Alex wins if dice >11 AND coin is heads." Did coin flip cause win? **Yes**.

## 3. **Intentionality: Side Effects vs. Direct Intention**
- **Rule:** If the agent *knows* a side effect will occur but *does not care* about it, **it is NOT intentional** (unless the side effect is negative/harmful, then people often say "Yes").
- **Cues:**
  - "I know X will happen, but I don't care about X, I just want Y."
  - **If X is positive:** **No** (not intentional).
  - **If X is negative/harmful:** **Yes** (intentional).
- **Examples:**
  - CEO increases profits, knows it will harm environment, doesn't care: **Yes** (intentional harm).
  - CEO increases profits, knows it will help environment, doesn't care: **No** (not intentional help).
  - Hunter shoots deer, knows eagle will fly away, doesn't care: **No** (not intentional).
  - Hunter shoots deer, knows bullet will hit birdwatcher, doesn't care: **Yes** (intentional).

---

## 4. **Omissions and Responsibility**
- **Rule:** If someone *fails* to do something, and it is their responsibility, and the effect occurs, **Yes** (cause).
- If it is *not* their responsibility, **No**.
- **Cues:**
  - "If Janet doesn't oil, it's Kate's responsibility." If Kate doesn't, **Yes**.
  - "If Janet doesn't oil, it's NOT Kate's responsibility." If Kate doesn't, **No**.

---

## 5. **Simultaneous Actions (Multiple Agents)**
- **Rule:** If two people act at the same time and both are needed for the effect, **each is a cause**.
- If only one is needed, and both act, **the one violating the norm or expectation is usually considered the cause**.
- **Cues:**
  - "If two people log in, computer crashes." Both log in, one violates policy: **Violator = Yes**, other = **No**.

---

## 6. **Preemption & Backup Causes**
- **Rule:** If one cause preempts another (e.g., poison and car crash), **the actual cause is the one that actually brings about the effect first**.
- **Cues:**
  - "Poison in blood, but death by car crash." Did poison cause death? **No**.
  - "Long-term asbestos exposure, but death by allergic reaction to medication." Did asbestos cause death? **Yes** (since he was certain to die soon anyway).

---

## 7. **Disjunctions (OR conditions)**
- **Rule:** If the effect occurs if *either* A or B, and both A and B are present, **the less expected or less typical one is NOT considered the cause**.
- **Cues:**
  - "Device charges if plugged in OR on pad. Both are true. Did leaving on pad cause charge?" **Yes**.
  - "Motorboat starts if gear in neutral OR motor locked. Both are true. Did changing motor cause start?" **No** (since gear was already in neutral).

---

## 8. **Unintentional Success**
- **Rule:** If someone tries to do X but succeeds by accident (e.g., hand slips, but still hits target), **NOT intentional**.
- **Cues:**
  - "Aims, hand slips, but still hits." **No** (not intentional).

---

## 9. **Norm Violation**
- **Rule:** If two people act, but only one violates a rule or norm, **the violator is considered the cause**.
- **Cues:**
  - "Only one is supposed to log in, both do, crash." **Violator = Yes**, other = **No**.

---

## 10. **Absence of Knowledge**
- **Rule:** If someone acts without knowledge of a rule or effect, **less likely to be considered the cause**.
- **Cues:**
  - "Hedgehog didn't know rule, took pencil, problem." **Yes** (if didn't know), **No** (if knew).

---

## 11. **Redundant Actions**
- **Rule:** If multiple people do something, but only one is needed, and all usually do it, **each is a cause** if their action is not redundant.
- If their action is redundant (e.g., many always order coffee), **No**.

**Tip:** When in doubt, ask:  
- Was this action necessary for the outcome?  
- Was it the only sufficient cause?  
- Did the person intend the effect, or just foresee it?  
- Did they violate a norm or rule?  
- Was their omission a failure of responsibility?
