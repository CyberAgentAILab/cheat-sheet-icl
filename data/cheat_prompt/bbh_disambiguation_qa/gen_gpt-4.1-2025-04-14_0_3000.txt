# Pronoun Antecedent Cheat Sheet

## 1. **Ambiguous Pronouns: When Both Antecedents Are Possible**
- If both possible referents make sense grammatically and contextually, and there is no clear clue, **the answer is "Ambiguous"**.
- Common ambiguous structures:
    - "X did Y because (pronoun) Z" (e.g., "The nurse stayed away from the laborer because she was busy.")
    - "X met with Y because (pronoun) did Z."
    - "X told Y that (pronoun) did Z." (when both X and Y could have done Z)
    - "X and Y discuss (pronoun) Z." (when both X and Y could own Z)
    - "Before (pronoun) did Z, X did Y." (when both X and Y could be the pronoun)
    - "X greets Y because (pronoun) did Z." (when both could be the pronoun)
    - "X disliked Y because (pronoun) is Z." (when both could be the pronoun)

**Tip:** If you can substitute both X and Y for the pronoun and the sentence still makes sense, and there’s no context to prefer one, choose "Ambiguous".

## 2. **Causality and Logic: Who Would Do What?**
- **Action/Reason Structure:**  
    - "X did Y because (pronoun) did Z."
        - If Z is a reason for X to act, ask: Whose action would motivate X?
        - Example: "The laborer handed the secretary a hammer because they asked for a tool."
            - Who would ask for a tool? The secretary. So "they" = secretary.
- **Reporting/Informing Structure:**  
    - "X told Y that (pronoun) did Z."
        - Usually, X is telling Y about Y, or about X, but not about Y’s own knowledge.
        - If it’s a diagnosis, the patient is being told about themselves.
        - If it’s a confession, the speaker is talking about themselves.
- **Giving/Receiving Structure:**  
    - "X gave Y (pronoun) Z."
        - Usually, the recipient is Y, unless context says otherwise.
        - If "her/him/them" is the object after "gave," it usually refers to Y.

## 3. **Possessive Pronouns in Compound Phrases**
- "The writer and his/her/their friends"
    - The possessive ("his/her/their") refers to the first noun ("the writer"), not the friends or the object.
    - "Their" can be singular (gender-neutral) or plural, but still refers to "the writer" in this structure.

---

## 4. **Plural Pronouns ("they/their")**
- If both referents are singular, "they" can be singular (gender-neutral) or plural (both together).
- If both X and Y are possible, and both could be referred to as "they," and context doesn't clarify, **choose "Ambiguous"**.
- If only one referent is plural, "they" likely refers to the plural noun.

---

## 5. **Contextual Clues:**
- **Job Roles/Expertise:**  
    - If the action or attribute is more likely for one role, prefer that one.
        - E.g., "The undergraduate applied to work with the scientist because she needed a lab assistant."  
          Undergraduates don’t need assistants; scientists do.
- **Ownership/Responsibility:**  
    - If the sentence is about a car, and a mechanic calls a customer, the car is the customer's.
    - If the sentence is about a grading policy, the educator owns it, not the student.

## 6. **Gender and Number Agreement**
- If the pronoun is "her/his/she/he," check which noun matches in gender and number.
- If only one noun matches, that's the antecedent.
- If both match, use context and logic.

---

## 7. **"Because" and "So" Clauses**
- "X did Y because (pronoun) did Z."
    - Ask: Whose action would be the reason for X's action?
    - If both could be the reason, it's ambiguous.

---

## 8. **"Asked" and "Told" Structures**
- "X asked Y if (pronoun) could/would/should Z."
    - Usually, X is asking Y about Y (the person being asked).
    - If the question is about X's own ability, then X is the antecedent.
    - Use logic: Would it make sense for X to ask Y about X, or about Y?

---

## 9. **"After/Before" Clauses**
- "After/Before (pronoun) did Z, X did Y."
    - If both X and Y could have done Z, and context doesn't clarify, it's ambiguous.

---

## 10. **General Tips**
- **Substitute each possible antecedent and see which makes more sense.**
- **If both make sense and context doesn't clarify, choose "Ambiguous."**
- **If only one makes sense, that's the answer.**
- **If the pronoun is possessive in a compound noun phrase, it usually refers to the first noun.**
- **If the pronoun is plural and both referents are singular, check if it could refer to both together. If not, and both are possible, it's ambiguous.**

---

**Practice:**  
For each question, write out the sentence twice, substituting each possible antecedent for the pronoun. If both are logical, it's ambiguous. If only one is logical, that's your answer.

---

**Remember:**  
- **Ambiguity is common** in these structures. Don't overthink—if both are possible, mark "Ambiguous."
- **Context and logic** are your best tools for disambiguation.

**End of Cheat Sheet**

Follow the format of the examples below in your response.

Question: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: The nurse stayed away from the laborer because they were very busy.
Options:
(A) The nurse was busy
(B) The laborer was busy
(C) Ambiguous
Reasoning: Let's think step by step.  
Here we need to determine who the pronoun "they" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for "they": the nurse and the laborer. The sentence is of the form "X stayed away from Y because (X or Y) were very busy."  
Let's consider Y first: "X stayed away from Y because Y was very busy." This makes sense, as X might avoid Y if Y is busy.  
Now, consider X: "X stayed away from Y because X was very busy." This also makes sense, as X might avoid Y if X is busy.  
Because both interpretations are possible and the sentence does not provide enough context to choose between them, the antecedent of "they" is ambiguous. So the answer is (C).
Answer: (C)
###
Question: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: The patient disclosed to the counselor that they had a history of substance abuse.
Options:
(A) The patient had a history
(B) The counselor had a history
(C) Ambiguous
Reasoning: Let's think step by step.  
Here we need to determine who the pronoun "they" refers to. There are two possible referents: the patient and the counselor. The verb "disclosed" and the phrase "had a history of substance abuse" might help us decide. Let X be the patient and Y the counselor. The sentence is of the form "X disclosed to Y that (X or Y) had a history of substance abuse."

Let's consider Y first: "X disclosed to Y that Y had a history of substance abuse." This would mean the patient is telling the counselor about the counselor's own history, which is unlikely, since the counselor would already know their own history.

Now, consider X: "X disclosed to Y that X had a history of substance abuse." This makes sense, because the patient is sharing personal information with the counselor.

Because in this context, X is the patient and Y is the counselor, the answer should be the patient. So the answer is (A).
Answer: (A)
