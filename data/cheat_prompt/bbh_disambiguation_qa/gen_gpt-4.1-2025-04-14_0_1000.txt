# Pronoun Antecedent Cheat Sheet (for Difficult Cases)

## 1. **General Reasoning Steps**
- **Identify all possible antecedents** for the pronoun.
- **Substitute each antecedent** into the sentence to see if it makes sense.
- **Consider the context and logic** of the sentence: Who is likely to perform the action or possess the attribute?
- **Check for grammatical cues**: number (singular/plural), gender, and role in the sentence.
- **If both options are equally plausible and the sentence gives no extra clues, mark as ambiguous.**

## 2. **Common Patterns and How to Resolve Them**

### A. **"X told Y that [pronoun]..."**
- Usually, the pronoun refers to **Y** if the information is about Y (e.g., advice, diagnosis, payment).
- If the information is about X's own actions or status, it refers to **X**.
- **Tip:** Would it make sense for X to inform Y about Y's own actions? Usually not, unless it's advice or a warning.

### B. **"X did something to Y because [pronoun]..."**
- The pronoun can refer to either X or Y.
- **Test both:** Substitute both and see which makes more logical sense.
- If both are plausible, **mark as ambiguous**.

### C. **"X and Y discuss [pronoun]'s Z"**
- If both X and Y could logically possess Z, and the sentence gives no further context, **mark as ambiguous**.
- If only one is likely to possess Z (e.g., "culinary training" is more likely the chef's), pick that one.

### D. **"X called Y and asked [pronoun] to do Z"**
- The pronoun usually refers to **Y** (the person being asked to do something).
- If it would be odd for X to ask themselves, it's almost always Y.

### E. **"X met with Y at [pronoun]'s office"**
- If both X and Y could be the owner of the office, and the sentence gives no clue, **mark as ambiguous**.
- If only one is plausible (e.g., meeting a director at the director's office), pick that one.

### F. **"X did something with Y because [pronoun] [verb/attribute]"**
- If the verb/attribute fits both X and Y, and both are plausible, **mark as ambiguous**.
- If only one makes sense (e.g., "focuses on code" fits developer, not writer), pick that one.

### G. **Possessive Constructions ("the writer and [pronoun] friends")**
- The possessive pronoun almost always refers to the first noun ("the writer and her friends" = the writer's friends).
- If the pronoun could refer to more than one noun, but only one makes sense, pick that one.

## 3. **Ambiguity Triggers**
- If both antecedents are equally plausible and the sentence gives no further context, **choose "Ambiguous"**.
- Watch for sentences where both X and Y could have performed the action, received the attribute, or owned the object.

---

## 4. **Special Cues**
- **Gender/Number Agreement:** Make sure the pronoun matches the possible antecedent in gender and number.
- **Role/Profession:** Sometimes, the profession or role makes one antecedent more likely (e.g., only a scientist needs a lab assistant).
- **Typical Scenarios:** Use real-world logic (e.g., a mechanic calls a customer about the customer's car, not their own).

## 5. **Quick Reference Table**

| Structure                                      | Most Likely Antecedent | When Ambiguous?                |
|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------|
| X told Y that [pronoun]...                     | Y (if advice/info)    | If both could be true         |
| X did Y because [pronoun]...                   | X or Y (test both)    | If both make sense            |
| X and Y discuss [pronoun]'s Z                  | Context-dependent     | If both could own Z           |
| X called Y and asked [pronoun] to do Z         | Y                     | If both could be asked        |
| X met with Y at [pronoun]'s office             | Context-dependent     | If both could own office      |
| X did Y because [pronoun] [verb/attribute]     | Context-dependent     | If both fit                   |
| The writer and [pronoun] friends               | The writer            | If only one makes sense       |

## 6. **Ambiguity Checklist**
- Both antecedents are grammatically possible.
- Both antecedents are logically possible.
- No context or world knowledge tips the scale.
- If all above are true, **choose "Ambiguous"**.

**Use this sheet to reason through each step, especially when both antecedents seem possible!**

Follow the format of the examples below in your response.

Question: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: The technician told the customer that they could pay with cash.
Options:
(A) The technician could pay
(B) The customer could pay
(C) Ambiguous
Reasoning: Let's think step by step.  
Here we need to determine who the pronoun "they" refers to. There are two possible referents: the technician and the customer. The verb "told" and the phrase "could pay with cash" might help us decide. Let X be the technician and Y the customer. The sentence is of the form "X told Y that (X or Y) could pay with cash."

Let's consider Y first: "X told Y that Y could pay with cash." This makes sense, because the technician is likely informing the customer about their payment options.

Now, consider X: "X told Y that X could pay with cash." This is less likely, because it would be odd for the technician to tell the customer about the technician's own ability to pay.

Therefore, the pronoun "they" most likely refers to the customer. So the answer is (B).
Answer: (B)
###
Question: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: Alex did not know Taylor until she sent a letter.
Options:
(A) Alex sent the letter
(B) Taylor sent the letter
(C) Ambiguous
Reasoning: Let's think step by step.  
Here we need to determine who the pronoun "she" refers to. There are two possible referents for "she": Alex and Taylor. The sentence is of the form "X did not know Y until she sent a letter."  
Let's consider Y first: "X did not know Y until Y sent a letter." This makes sense, as Y could have initiated contact by sending a letter, leading to X knowing Y.  
Now, consider X: "X did not know Y until X sent a letter." This also makes sense, as X could have sent a letter to Y, which could have led to them getting to know each other.  
Because both interpretations are possible and the sentence does not provide enough information to determine which one is correct, the antecedent of "she" is ambiguous. So the answer is (C).
Answer: (C)
