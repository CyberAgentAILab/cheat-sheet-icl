**Pronoun Antecedent Cheat Sheet (for Difficult Cases)**

---

### 1. **Ambiguity: When to Choose "Ambiguous"**

- If a pronoun (he, she, they, their, etc.) could grammatically refer to more than one noun in the sentence, and there is no clear context or gender/number cue, the answer is **Ambiguous**.
    - *Example*: "The nurse stayed away from the laborer because she was very busy." (Could be either)
    - *Example*: "Alex did not know Taylor until he sent a letter." (Could be either)

---

### 2. **"They/Their" with Two People of the Same Gender or Unknown Gender**

- If both nouns could be referred to by "they/their" (e.g., both are singular, or both could be plural), and context does not clarify, choose **Ambiguous**.
    - *Example*: "The developer met with the designer because their idea can be implemented." (Could be either)
    - *Example*: "The student set up a meeting with the architect to review their blueprints." (Could be either)

---

### 3. **Possessive Pronouns with Multiple Nouns**

- If a possessive pronoun (his, her, their) follows two nouns joined by "and," and both could logically possess the object, it's **Ambiguous** unless context or gender clarifies.
    - *Example*: "The reporter and the chef discuss her favorite dishes." (Could be either)
    - *Exception*: If only one noun matches the pronoun's gender, it's that one.
        - "The customer and the chef discuss her culinary training." (If only chef is female, it's chef.)

---

### 4. **"Because" Clauses: Who is the Subject?**

- In "because [pronoun] [verb]" clauses, the pronoun often refers to the person whose state or action is the reason for the main clause, but if both could fit, it's **Ambiguous**.
    - *Example*: "The mechanic greets the receptionist because she is standing in front of the door." (Could be either)
    - *Example*: "The developer was unable to communicate with the writer because they used big words." (Could be either)

---

### 5. **"That" Clauses: Who is Being Described?**

- In "told X that [pronoun] [verb]" or "warned X that [pronoun] [verb]" structures:
    - The pronoun usually refers to the person being told/warned **if** the action logically applies to them.
    - If both could fit, or the action could apply to either, it's **Ambiguous**.
    - *Example*: "The surgeon warned the nurse that she needed more time to prepare." (Could be either)
    - *Example*: "The carpenter told the onlooker that he had been working on the house." (Usually the carpenter, as the onlooker is unlikely to be working.)

---

### 6. **"Asked [pronoun] to [verb]"**

- The pronoun usually refers to the person being asked, i.e., the second person mentioned.
    - *Example*: "The guard called the cleaner and asked her to open the door." (Cleaner)
    - *If both could be asked, and context doesn't clarify, it's Ambiguous.*

---

### 7. **"Because [pronoun] [verb]" with Adjectives**

- If the adjective could describe either noun, and context doesn't clarify, it's **Ambiguous**.
    - *Example*: "The nurse was running from the laborer because she smelled awful." (Could be either)

---

### 8. **"His/Her/Their Office" After Two People**

- If "his/her/their office" follows two people, and both could have an office, it's **Ambiguous** unless context or gender clarifies.
    - *Example*: "Bailey planned to meet the director at his office." (Ambiguous if both could be male)
    - *If only one matches the pronoun's gender, it's that one.*

---

### 9. **"Support" or "Friends" Phrases**

- "The writer and his/her/their friends' support" â€” "his/her/their" refers to the writer, not the friends or the story.
    - *Example*: "This story could not be published without the writer and her friends' support." (Writer's friends)

---

### 10. **"Because [pronoun] [verb]" with Actions**

- If the action is something only one of the nouns would logically do, pick that one.
    - *Example*: "The laborer handed the secretary a hammer because they asked for a tool." (Secretary asked)
    - *If both could do the action, and context doesn't clarify, it's Ambiguous.*

---

### 11. **"Told [pronoun] a story" or "Gave [pronoun] a thing"**

- The pronoun refers to the person receiving the story/thing, usually the second noun.
    - *Example*: "The writer tried to fool the salesperson and told him a fake story." (Salesperson)

---

### 12. **"Needed to Understand" or "Needed Help"**

- If the action is something only one would logically do, pick that one.
    - *Example*: "The lawyer looked into illegal accusations against the cashier, because he needed to understand the case." (Lawyer)
    - *If both could need to understand, and context doesn't clarify, it's Ambiguous.*

---

### 13. **"His/Her/Their Grading Policy"**

- If "grading policy" is mentioned, and only one is likely to have it (e.g., educator vs. student), pick the logical one.
    - *Example*: "The educator was meeting with a student to discuss his grading policy." (Educator)

---

### 14. **"He/She/They Had Cancer"**

- In "told X that he/she/they had cancer," the pronoun usually refers to the person being told, unless context says otherwise.
    - *Example*: "The physician told the baker that he had cancer." (Baker)

---

### 15. **"His/Her/Their Car"**

- In "told the customer that her car would be ready," the car belongs to the customer.

---

### 16. **"His/Her/Their Performance"**

- In "gave the employee feedback on his/her/their performance," the performance is the employee's.

---

### 17. **"His/Her/Their Blueprints"**

- In "set up a meeting with the architect to review her/their blueprints," if both could have blueprints, and context doesn't clarify, it's **Ambiguous**.

---

### 18. **"Because [pronoun] [verb]" with "Focuses on Code"**

- If only one is likely to focus on code (e.g., developer vs. writer), pick the logical one.
    - *Example*: "The developer was unable to communicate with the writer because he focuses on code." (Developer)

---

### 19. **"Asked if [pronoun] needs/could borrow"**

- The pronoun usually refers to the person being asked about, not the asker.
    - *Example*: "The assistant asked the physician if he needs any help." (Physician)

---

### 20. **"Collaborated and gave him/her/them"**

- The pronoun refers to the person receiving the object, usually the second noun.
    - *Example*: "The carpenter collaborated with the designer and gave him a prototype." (Designer)

---

**General Tips:**
- If the pronoun matches only one noun in gender/number, it's that one.
- If both nouns could be referred to by the pronoun, and context doesn't clarify, it's **Ambiguous**.
- For "because [pronoun] [verb]" or "that [pronoun] [verb]" clauses, consider who would logically perform the action or be in the state described.
- For possessives after two nouns, if both could possess, and context doesn't clarify, it's **Ambiguous**.

---

**Practice:**
- For each question, identify the two possible antecedents.
- Check if the pronoun's gender/number matches only one.
- Ask: Who would logically do the action or possess the object?
- If still unclear, choose **Ambiguous**.
