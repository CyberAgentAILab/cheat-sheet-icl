**Pronoun Antecedent Cheat Sheet (for Difficult Cases)**

---

### 1. **Ambiguity with Multiple Same-Gender Nouns**
- If two nouns of the same gender (e.g., both male or both female) are present and a pronoun (he/she/his/her) is used, **it is ambiguous** unless context or world knowledge clearly favors one.
  - *Example*: "Alex did not know Taylor until she sent a letter."  
    → Both could be "she" → **Ambiguous**

---

### 2. **"They/Their/Them" with Two People**
- If "they/their/them" could refer to either of two people, and both are singular, **it is ambiguous** unless context or world knowledge makes it clear.
  - *Example*: "The developer met with the designer because their idea can be implemented."  
    → Whose idea? Both could have an idea → **Ambiguous**

---

### 3. **Possessive Pronouns with Two Nouns**
- "His/her/their" before a noun (e.g., "his office") is **ambiguous** if both people could logically own the noun, unless context or world knowledge clarifies.
  - *Example*: "Bailey planned to meet the director at his office."  
    → Both could have an office → **Ambiguous**

---

### 4. **"Because [pronoun]..." Clauses**
- If "because he/she/they..." follows two possible antecedents, and both could logically fit, **it is ambiguous**.
  - *Example*: "The developer met with the secretary because she made a mistake."  
    → Both could have made a mistake → **Ambiguous**

---

### 5. **"And [pronoun]" After Two Nouns**
- If two people are joined by "and", and then "he/she/they" is used, **it is ambiguous** unless context or world knowledge clarifies.
  - *Example*: "The scientist collaborated with the artist, and he shared a story."  
    → Both could be "he" → **Ambiguous**

---

### 6. **"Their" with Plural Subjects**
- If "their" refers to a group (e.g., "the reporter and the chef will discuss their favorite dishes"), and both could have "favorite dishes", **it is ambiguous**.
  - *Example*: "The reporter and the chef will discuss their favorite dishes."  
    → Both have favorite dishes → **Ambiguous**

---

### 7. **"They" as Singular or Plural**
- "They" can be singular (gender-neutral) or plural. If both antecedents are singular and of unknown gender, **it is ambiguous**.
  - *Example*: "The student set up a meeting with the architect to review their blueprints."  
    → Both could have blueprints → **Ambiguous**

---

### 8. **"At his/her/their office"**
- If both people could have an office, and the sentence is "X planned to meet Y at his/her/their office", **it is ambiguous**.
  - *Example*: "Bailey planned to meet the director at their office."  
    → Both could have an office → **Ambiguous**

---

### 9. **"Because [pronoun] [verb]" with Adjectives**
- If the reason clause uses an adjective (e.g., "because she was busy"), and both could be described that way, **it is ambiguous**.
  - *Example*: "The nurse stayed away from the laborer because she was very busy."  
    → Both could be busy → **Ambiguous**

---

### 10. **"After meeting with [plural], X goes to their office"**
- If "their" could refer to either the plural group or to X (if X is nonbinary), **it is ambiguous**.
  - *Example*: "After meeting with the producers, Sam goes to their office."  
    → Could be Sam's or producers' office → **Ambiguous**

---

### 11. **"Told [pronoun] a story" or "Asked [pronoun] to..."**
- If the verb is "told/asked" and the pronoun could refer to either person, but the structure is "X [verb] Y and told/asked him/her/them...", the pronoun usually refers to Y (the second person).
  - *Example*: "The writer tried to fool the salesperson and told him a fake story."  
    → "him" = salesperson

---

### 12. **World Knowledge**
- Sometimes, world knowledge helps:
  - "The physician told the baker that they had cancer."  
    → More likely the baker had cancer, as the physician is the doctor.

---

### 13. **"Because [pronoun] [verb]" with Verbs**
- If the verb is something only one person would do (e.g., "because she upholds the peace" and one is a sheriff), use world knowledge.
  - *Example*: "The sheriff protected the writer because she upholds the peace."  
    → Sheriff upholds the peace.

---

### 14. **"The [role] told the [other role] that [pronoun] [verb]"**
- The pronoun usually refers to the second person (the one being told), unless context or world knowledge says otherwise.
  - *Example*: "The technician told the customer that she could pay with cash."  
    → "she" = customer

---

### 15. **"The [role] gave the [other role] feedback on [pronoun] performance"**
- The pronoun usually refers to the second person (the one receiving feedback).
  - *Example*: "The supervisor gave the employee feedback on her performance."  
    → "her" = employee

| "X met Y at his/her/their office"              | Context/world knowledge    | Ambiguous              |

**Key:**
- If context or world knowledge does not clearly favor one, **choose "Ambiguous"**.
- If the pronoun is in a clause about an action or attribute that only one person could logically have, use world knowledge.
- If the pronoun is possessive and both could own the thing, **Ambiguous**.

---

**Tip:**  
When in doubt, ask: "Could both people fit this pronoun equally well?"  
- If yes → **Ambiguous**  
- If no → Use context or world knowledge to decide.
