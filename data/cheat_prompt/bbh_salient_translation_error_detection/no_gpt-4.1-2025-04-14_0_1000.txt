## CHEAT SHEET: Identifying Translation Error Types

### 1. **Named Entities (D)**
- **Definition:** A proper noun (person, place, organization, etc.) is changed to a different entity, or is mistranslated.
- **Clues:**
  - Names of people, cities, countries, organizations, or specific titles are different in source and translation.
  - Misspellings or anglicizations that change the entity (e.g., "Stederdorf" → "Seedorf", "Naumburg" → "Tossel").
  - Swapping to a different but similar-sounding entity (e.g., "Dazaifu" → "Darfur").
  - Changing the type of entity (e.g., "Büsserach" in "Bezirk Thierstein" → "district of Thorstein").
  - Changing a family name to a first name, or vice versa.
  - Changing a specific organization or project name (e.g., "Pfälzerwald-Vereins" → "Palestine Forest Association").
- **Common traps:** 
  - Place names that look similar but are not the same.
  - Names that are replaced with generic terms or other names.
  - Titles or honorifics that are omitted or changed.

---

### 2. **Numerical Values (B)**
- **Definition:** Any change in numbers, dates, units, or ordinals.
- **Clues:**
  - Numbers (cardinal or ordinal) are different (e.g., "34." → "39th", "11." → "12th").
  - Dates are changed (e.g., "1847 gegründet" → "destroyed in 1847").
  - Units are changed (e.g., "100 Meter" → "100 miles", "2200 Meter" → "22000 metres").
  - Quantities, population, or counts are different (e.g., "19,570 Einwohnern" → "70 inhabitants").
  - Ranges are changed (e.g., "76–82 Gattungen" → "76-82 genera and 360 living species").
  - Years, centuries, or time periods are altered (e.g., "1759" → "1659", "1999" → "1989").
- **Common traps:**
  - Units (meters vs. miles, mm vs. km, etc.).
  - Ordinals (4th vs. 6th, etc.).
  - Population or count numbers.
  - Dates of events, founding, or publication.

---

### 3. **Modifiers or Adjectives (A)**
- **Definition:** Adjectives or descriptive modifiers are changed, omitted, or added, altering the meaning.
- **Clues:**
  - Nationality or origin adjectives are changed (e.g., "österreichischer" → "Australian").
  - Descriptive adjectives are changed (e.g., "Jazzmusiker" → "hit musician", "besonders schnelle Computer" → "particularly small computers").
  - Type or category adjectives are changed (e.g., "mittelalterlicher Bau" → "modern building").
  - Family or group adjectives are changed (e.g., "Bundeswappen" → "coat of arms").
  - Adjectives indicating size, age, or other qualities are altered.
- **Common traps:**
  - Subtle changes in meaning due to adjective swap.
  - Omission of adjectives that are present in the source.
  - Addition of adjectives not in the source.

---

### 4. **Negation or Antonyms (C)**
- **Definition:** A negation is added/removed, or a word is replaced with its antonym or comparative.
- **Clues:**
  - "Open" → "closed", "living" → "extinct", "urban" → "rural", "beginning" → "end".
  - "Complete" → "incomplete", "lime-loving" → "lime-hating".
  - "Listed" → "unlisted".
  - "Third largest" → "third smallest".
  - "Non-alcoholic" → "alcoholic" (or vice versa).
  - "Set on fire" → "set on ice".
- **Common traps:**
  - Words that are opposites or have a negation prefix/suffix.
  - Comparative or superlative adjectives swapped for their antonyms.
  - Negation words ("not", "no", "un-", "in-", etc.) added or removed.

---

### 5. **Dropped Content (E)**
- **Definition:** A significant clause or piece of information is omitted in the translation.
- **Clues:**
  - The translation is much shorter than the source, missing a clause or phrase.
  - Lists in the source are incomplete in the translation.
  - A location, date, or other detail present in the source is missing.
  - The translation omits a secondary or qualifying phrase (e.g., "as well as..." or "including...").
- **Common traps:**
  - Long sentences where the translation only covers the first part.
  - Lists or enumerations that are cut short.
  - Omission of a clause that changes the meaning or completeness.

---

### 6. **Facts (F)**
- **Definition:** Factual errors not covered by the above categories (e.g., wrong profession, wrong type, wrong function).
- **Clues:**
  - The translation gives a wrong fact (e.g., "footballer" → "goalkeeper" when not specified, "teacher" → "hack", "dancer" instead of "painter").
  - The translation changes the type or function (e.g., "typewriter" → "vehicle").
  - The translation gives a wrong category or function (e.g., "genus" → "family", "region" → "country").
  - The translation gives a wrong profession, field, or type.
- **Common traps:**
  - When the error is not about names, numbers, adjectives, negation, or dropped content, but the fact is simply wrong.
  - Mistranslation of professions, types, or categories.

## **Quick Decision Tree**
1. **Is a proper noun (name, place, organization) changed?** → **Named Entities (D)**
2. **Is a number, date, or unit changed?** → **Numerical Values (B)**
3. **Is an adjective or descriptive word changed/omitted/added?** → **Modifiers or Adjectives (A)**
4. **Is a negation or antonym introduced/removed?** → **Negation or Antonyms (C)**
5. **Is a significant clause or list item missing?** → **Dropped Content (E)**
6. **Is there a factual error not covered above?** → **Facts (F)**

---

**Tip:** If you are stuck, check for numbers and names first (they are most objective), then look for adjectives and negations, then for missing content, and finally for general factual mismatches.
