Question: The following translations from German to English contain a particular error. That error will be one of the following types: Named Entities: An entity (names, places, locations, etc.) is changed to a different entity. Numerical Values: Numerical values (ordinals or cardinals), dates, and/or units are changed. Modifiers or Adjectives: The modifiers and adjectives pertaining to a noun are changed. Negation or Antonyms: Introduce or remove a negation or change comparatives to their antonyms. Facts: Trivial factual errors not pertaining to the above classes are introduced in the translations. Dropped Content: A significant clause in the translation is removed. Please identify that error.  Source: Ruth Lynn Deech, Baroness Deech DBE ist eine britische Juristin und Hochschullehrerin, die seit 2005 als Life Peeress Mitglied des House of Lords ist.

The translation contains an error pertaining to
Options:
(A) Modifiers or Adjectives
(B) Numerical Values
(C) Negation or Antonyms
(D) Named Entities
(E) Dropped Content
(F) Facts
Reasoning: Let's think step by step.  
We solve this question by first translating the source sentence to English and then by comparing our translation with the provided translation. According to Google Translate, the correct translation of the source sentence from German to English is "Ruth Lynn Deech, Baroness Deech DBE, is a British lawyer and university lecturer who has been a life peeress and member of the House of Lords since 2005." The provided translation says "since 2015" instead of "since 2005." Because the numerical value for the year is changed from 2005 to 2015, the translation contains an error pertaining to Numerical Values. So the answer is (B).
Answer: (B)

Reasoning: Let's think step by step.

We solve this question by first translating the source sentence to English and then by comparing our translation with the provided translation. According to Google Translate, the correct translation of the source sentence from German to English is "Beth Clare Rodford is a former British rower." On the other hand, the provided translation is "Beth Clare Rodford is a British rower." The word "former" (ehemalige) is an important modifier that indicates she is no longer a rower, but this was omitted in the translation. Because the modifier "former" was dropped, the translation contains an error pertaining to Modifiers or Adjectives. So the answer is (A).
