## CHEAT SHEET: Identifying Error Types in German-English Translation

### 1. **Named Entities (D)**
- **Definition:** A proper noun (person, place, organization, etc.) is changed to a different entity, or is mistranslated, or omitted.
- **Clues:**
  - Person’s name is changed, shortened, or replaced (e.g., "Boyd Kevin Rutherford" → "Boyd").
  - Place names are mistranslated or replaced (e.g., "Büsserach im Bezirk Thierstein" → "Thorstein").
  - Organization names, book titles, or other unique identifiers are altered.
  - If a specific name is replaced with a generic term or a different name.
- **Common Traps:**
  - Similar-sounding but incorrect names (e.g., "Chūō" → "Cha").
  - Place names replaced with incorrect or generic locations.
  - Omission of part of a name (e.g., "Richard Raphael Roland Risse" → "Risse").
  - Swapping to a different but related entity (e.g., "Ferenc Farkas" → "Ferenc Puskas").

---

### 2. **Numerical Values (B)**
- **Definition:** Any change in numbers, dates, units, or ordinals (1st, 2nd, etc.).
- **Clues:**
  - Numbers (population, years, counts) are different between source and translation.
  - Dates are changed (e.g., "1759" → "1659").
  - Units are changed (e.g., "m" to "km", "ha" to "km", "Meter" to "mile").
  - Ordinals are changed (e.g., "34." → "39th").
  - Ranges are changed (e.g., "76–82" → "76–82" but "260" → "360").
- **Common Traps:**
  - Numbers that look similar but are not the same.
  - Units of measurement (meters vs. kilometers, etc.).
  - Years and dates, especially in historical contexts.
  - Population numbers, counts of objects, or event numbers.

---

### 3. **Modifiers or Adjectives (A)**
- **Definition:** Adjectives or descriptive words attached to nouns are changed, omitted, or replaced.
- **Clues:**
  - Words like "former", "German", "French", "large", "small", "baroque", "modern", etc., are changed or missing.
  - The translation omits or changes a descriptive word (e.g., "ehemalige britische Ruderin" → "British rower" [missing "former"]).
  - Nationality or other descriptors are changed (e.g., "deutsche Bildhauerin" → "French sculptor").
  - Adjectives describing the type or quality of something are altered (e.g., "mittelalterlicher Bau" → "modern building").
- **Common Traps:**
  - Nationality adjectives (German, Austrian, etc.).
  - Words like "former", "current", "main", "largest", "smallest", etc.
  - Descriptive adjectives about objects or people.

---

### 4. **Negation or Antonyms (C)**
- **Definition:** A negation is added/removed, or a word is replaced with its opposite (antonym).
- **Clues:**
  - "Not", "no", "never", "none" is added or missing.
  - Adjectives/adverbs are replaced with their opposites (e.g., "living" ↔ "extinct", "lime-loving" ↔ "lime-hating", "beginning" ↔ "end", "third largest" ↔ "third smallest").
  - Comparative or superlative adjectives are reversed.
- **Common Traps:**
  - Subtle changes in meaning (e.g., "ausgestorben" [extinct] → "living").
  - "Former" vs. "current".
  - "Largest" vs. "smallest", "earliest" vs. "latest".

---

### 5. **Facts (F)**
- **Definition:** Factual errors that do not fit the above categories (e.g., wrong profession, wrong type, wrong function, but not a named entity or number).
- **Clues:**
  - The translation gives a wrong fact (e.g., "Schauspieler" [actor] → "director").
  - The type or function is wrong (e.g., "Schreibmaschine" [typewriter] → "vehicle").
  - The translation changes the subject to something else (e.g., "Gerichte" [courts] → "stadiums").
  - The translation gives a wrong family, group, or category (e.g., "Rabenvögel" [corvids] → "Columbine family").
- **Common Traps:**
  - Profession or type is changed (e.g., "Malerin" [painter] → "dancer").
  - The translation is plausible but not correct.
  - The translation is too generic or too specific in a way that changes the fact.

---

### 6. **Dropped Content (E)**
- **Definition:** A significant clause or piece of information is missing from the translation.
- **Clues:**
  - The translation is much shorter than the source and omits a key clause or fact.
  - Numbers, names, or descriptors are missing entirely.
  - The translation leaves out a whole phrase or sentence that is present in the source.
- **Common Traps:**
  - Only part of the original sentence is translated.
  - Lists or enumerations are cut short.
  - Important context or qualifiers are missing.

## **Quick Decision Tree**
1. **Is a name, place, or unique entity changed or omitted?** → **Named Entities (D)**
2. **Is a number, date, or unit changed?** → **Numerical Values (B)**
3. **Is an adjective or descriptive word changed, omitted, or replaced?** → **Modifiers or Adjectives (A)**
4. **Is a negation added/removed, or is an antonym used?** → **Negation or Antonyms (C)**
5. **Is a factual detail wrong, but not a name, number, or adjective?** → **Facts (F)**
6. **Is a significant clause or information missing?** → **Dropped Content (E)**

---

**Tip:** If you’re unsure, check for numbers and names first—they are the most clear-cut. If not, look for adjectives or negations. If none of these, and the translation is just factually wrong, pick Facts (F).
