## CHEAT SHEET: "Find a Similar Movie" (90s/00s Hollywood Edition)

### 1. **Identify the Pattern in the Given List**

- **Genre:** Usually a mix of drama, crime, action, adventure, sometimes animation or comedy.
- **Fame:** All are well-known, mainstream, often award-winning or critically acclaimed.
- **Tone:** Serious, dramatic, or epic; sometimes family-friendly if animation is present.

### 2. **How to Eliminate Wrong Answers**
- **Obscure/Foreign/Indie:** If an option is obscure, foreign, or indie, it’s almost never the answer.
- **Wrong Era:** If the option is much older (pre-1980) or much newer (post-2010), it’s rarely correct unless the list is also from that era.
- **Wrong Genre:** If the option is horror, documentary, or a niche genre not present in the list, eliminate it.
- **Direct-to-Video/Sequels:** Avoid options that are sequels/spin-offs of lesser-known movies.

### 3. **How to Pick the Best Answer**
- **Match Era First:** 1990s or early 2000s Hollywood movies are almost always correct if the list is from that era.
- **Match Genre Second:** If the list is mostly drama/crime/action, pick an option with those genres.
- **Animation/Family:** If the list includes Disney or Pixar, look for another famous 90s animation.
- **Franchise/Director:** If the list includes a franchise (e.g., Star Wars, Indiana Jones), a related franchise movie is often correct.
- **Critical Acclaim:** If one option is a famous Oscar-winner or classic, and the rest are not, pick the classic.
