## CHEAT SHEET: "Find a Movie Similar To..." (90s/00s Hollywood Edition)

### 1. **Identify the Pattern**
- **Era:** Most source movies are from the 1980s, 1990s, or early 2000s.
- **Genre:** Look for overlap in genre (action, adventure, drama, crime, sci-fi, animation, etc.).
- **Fame/Acclaim:** The correct answer is almost always a well-known, critically acclaimed, or blockbuster film from the same era.
- **Tone/Style:** If the source movies are serious dramas, avoid comedies or animated films unless the source list includes them.

---

### 2. **Step-by-Step Process**

#### A. **Scan the Source List**
- Note the **decade** (usually 80s/90s/00s).
- Note the **genres** (action, drama, crime, adventure, animation, etc.).
- Note if the movies are **mainstream/popular** or **cult/arthouse**.

#### B. **Scan the Options**
- Eliminate any option that is:
  - Obscure or little-known.
  - From a very different era (e.g., 1950s, 2010s if the source is 90s).
  - A different genre (e.g., horror if the source is drama/adventure).
  - Foreign/arthouse if the source is mainstream Hollywood.

#### C. **Look for the Closest Match**
- **Same era** is most important.
- **Same genre** is next most important.
- **Fame/critical acclaim** is also key.
- If multiple options fit, pick the one with the most overlap in all three.

### 4. **Special Cases**
- **Animation/Family:** If the source list includes Disney or Pixar (e.g., The Lion King, Aladdin, Toy Story), the answer is likely another big 90s animated film.
- **Sci-Fi/Action:** If the source list is heavy on sci-fi/action (e.g., The Matrix, Star Wars, Terminator 2, Independence Day), the answer is likely another blockbuster sci-fi/action from the same era.
- **Crime/Drama:** If the source list is crime/drama heavy (e.g., Pulp Fiction, The Usual Suspects, Goodfellas, Fargo), the answer is likely another 90s crime/drama.
- **Historical/Epic:** If the source list includes historical epics (e.g., Braveheart, Schindler's List, Dances with Wolves), the answer is likely another 90s historical drama.

---

### 5. **Red Flags for Wrong Answers**

- **Sequels/prequels** that are not as famous as the originals.
- **Comedies** if the source list is all serious dramas (unless the comedy is a huge 90s hit).
